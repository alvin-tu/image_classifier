# Image-Based Amazon Search
by: Alvin Tu, Kelly Lin, and Steven Chang

This project for SB Hacks is an image-based search tool for Amazon. You upload an image, 
and our software predicts what the image is, then the a button will be avaiable to link
to Amazon with the top prediction. This program was created by implementing the MobileNet
classifier in TensorFlow, and the web app was built with HTML/CSS.
